The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a document or collection that doesn't exist.  This can happen if you've made a typo in your path, or if the document/collection was deleted.  The error messages aren't always super descriptive, sometimes just saying "Error: ..." or a similar unhelpful message. This makes debugging challenging, and you have to rely on logs and network monitoring tools to find the root cause.
